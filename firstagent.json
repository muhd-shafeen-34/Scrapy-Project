Their extensive and deep local knowledge of the real estate market combined with a high-touch and hands-on work style is laser-focused on not just earning, but sustaining the trust of every single client. And it’s working. 70% of their current business is from past client referrals. The 2 Rivers Team business model is built on a simple principle: offer a better value than their competitors with a people-first philosophy built on data-driven decision making. One way the team accomplishes this is by offering home staging services to their clients, free of charge.  From partnering with sellers to ensure they choose economically sensible home improvement projects that bear the highest ROI, to staging homes, to accompanying first-time buyers on marathon property tours, the 2 Rivers Team works tirelessly to represent every client’s individual needs and unique set of circumstances. Whether you are a first-time buyer, experienced seller, real estate developer, empty-nester, or looking to relocate in or out of the area, the 2 Rivers Team has the experience, network, and resources to serve any of your real estate needs.", "social": {"LinkedIn": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/randylivorsi/", "Instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/the2riversteam/?hl=en", "Facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/2riversteam/"}, "email": "2riversteam@compass.com", "title": "2 Rivers Team", "agent_phone_numbers": ["202-341-7530", "202-386-6330"], "office_phone_numbers": ["202-386-6330"]}
